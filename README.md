# Nonprofit Coin Ecosystem 🌍💡  

**The Main Ecosystem for All Nonprofit Coins**  

This repository hosts the foundational ecosystem for nonprofit-focused blockchain projects. Each participating nonprofit operates its own private ecosystem under the umbrella of **Nonprofit Coin**, supporting various decentralized functionalities, including:  

- ✅ **Token Swapping**  
- ✅ **Event Ticketing**  
- ✅ **NFT Marketplace**  
- ✅ **Decentralized Voting & Governance**  
- ✅ **Staking & Rewards**  

## 🏛 About Nonprofit Coin  

Nonprofit Coin serves as the **general governance token** for all nonprofit organizations within the ecosystem. Each nonprofit can issue its own dedicated token, but all tokens inherently hold **zero monetary value** and serve solely as governance votes.  

### 🔍 **501(c)(3) Compliance & Verification**  
To ensure legitimacy, all nonprofit tokens must undergo **automated 501(c)(3) verification** via the **Nonprofit 501(c)(3) Smart App**:  

- Verification occurs **at creation** and is **checked monthly** to maintain compliance.  
- Nonprofits failing compliance will have their tokens deactivated until resolved.  

## 💰 Tokenomics & Staking  

Each Nonprofit Coin is **pegged 1:1 with TRX**, with the following staking mechanism:  

1. **95% of staked TRX** is returned to the owner in the form of **Nonprofit Coin** or an individual **nonprofit-specific token**, depending on the staking preference.  
2. **5% of staked TRX** is allocated to the **Nonprofit Coin Surplus Wallet**, ensuring long-term sustainability and equitable redistribution.  
3. **Surplus funds** are automatically distributed **monthly** across compliant nonprofits.  
4. **The Surplus Wallet is immutable**, with keys destroyed after setup, ensuring a fair and transparent distribution process.  

## 🎟 **Governance & Voting**  

Holding specific nonprofit tokens unlocks:  

- **Voting rights** within that nonprofit's governance system.  
- **Unique staking benefits** determined by the nonprofit owner.
